	<meta name="description" content="a passionate appeal to the wolfpack at space150 as to why they should hire someone with my drive and potential as their Design or Engineering intern. Minneapolis and New York are my first choices, since I have family there, but I am definitely not opposed to LA, since they have good food and sunshine. And yes, source code makes me salivate!"/>

		<p>if you are looking for a young dewey eyed hipster fresh out of art school, then I'm not your man...and you're not the company I seek</p>
		<h2>I'm out to run with wolves</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>I seek the satisfaction that comes from overcoming fear, vanquishing foes, and persevering through hardship</p>
		<p>I want the type of experience that makes you stronger</p>
		<p>Not a summer job.</p>
		<p>Not another notch on my resume.</p>
		<p>But the fulfillment of some primal need</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>I have cut the tethers of mediocrity -- the excuses, the safety nets, the distractions -- destroying convention to create a man.</p>
		<p>I am staring the challenge in the face: WHO AM I GOING TO BE?!</p>
		<p>There is only one answer to that question; it is a way of life, not a destination</p>
